# EMAIL DETECTOR

A **production-grade email detection library** written in modern C++ with performance, security, and correctness as top priorities.

### âœ¨ Features

* **RFC-compliant validation** â€“ strict email format checks
* **Thread-safe** â€“ safe for concurrent usage with multiple threads
* **Performance optimized** â€“ lightweight, minimal memory footprint
* **Security hardened** â€“ input size limits to prevent DoS attacks
* **Exception safe** â€“ robust against runtime errors
* **Duplicate-free extraction** â€“ collects unique valid emails only
* **Benchmark & Test Suite** â€“ correctness validation and performance benchmarking included

### ðŸ“Œ Use Cases

* Detect and extract email addresses from untrusted input
* Protect applications from leaking sensitive user data
* Preprocess logs, text, or messages for compliance checks

### ðŸš€ Included Components

* `SensitiveEmailDetector` â€“ core detection and extraction logic
* `PerformanceTest` â€“ correctness and performance testing framework
* Example usage in `main.cpp`

This project is designed as a **ready-to-use utility** for integrating sensitive email detection into high-performance C++ systems.
